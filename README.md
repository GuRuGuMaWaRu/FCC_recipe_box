## FreeCodeCamp React Project - Recipe Box

## User Story
- [ ] I can create recipes that have names and ingredients.
- [ ] I can see an index view where the names of all the recipes are visible.
- [ ] I can click into any of those recipes to view it.
- [ ] I can edit these recipes.
- [ ] I can delete these recipes.
- [ ] All new recipes I add are saved in my browser's local storage. If I refresh the page, these recipes will still be there.

## Thoughts
Used create-react-app, and it crashed continuously when I tried add tests, so this time I decided to get on without them.

Inspired by [Live Coding with Jesse Weigel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbknyJ7hSrf1WKh_Xnv9RL1r) I used [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/). It certainly helped with design, but later on when I had to submit the project via Codepen, it turned out that I can't use Material-UI there. Boy, was I frustrated, and after several days of trying to solve it, I had to remake this project with [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/). So now I have two of these - one in Material-UI and another in React-Bootstrap.
